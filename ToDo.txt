Get euclidean location of center of neuropil?
  mean location of non-soma, non-axon nodes (or maybe tips)
Compute average branch length for stochastic growth model

in peelLength:
  investigate why sometimes fit routine fails
  deal with noise in a sensible fashion

in NeuronGeometry:
  Better tagging of specific compartments in soma
  Replace _axons, _axonsBranch with properties ?
  Reintroduce 1-node compartments
  Get rid of non-circular nodes
    Make compartments, segments fundamentally contain
      surfaceArea
      crossSectionArea
      length
      volume

neuron simulation:
  rationalize naming scheme (probably merge neuron_simulate.py with
    neuron_simulateGeometry.py)
    -make compatible with non-circular geometries
  make compatible with c++ simulate_neuron.bin
  

Create code to extract traces from .abf files

include noise-generation code rather than making calls to system
  This would entail moving to python instead of python3, since numpy doesn't
  work with python3 in ubuntu yet.

neuron_createModelHocFile.py:
  better mechanism for assigning external and internal calcium concentrations,
    near bottom of writeModelHocFile
  code hygiene
